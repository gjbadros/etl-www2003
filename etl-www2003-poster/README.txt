This is a final poster submission for WWW 2003, the 12th International Conference
on the World Wide Web, 20-24 May 2003, Budapest, Hungary.

We attempted to follow submission directions from:

http://www2003.org/poster/submission.htm

The four files:

index.html
index.xhtml
etl-wwww2003-poster.html
etl-wwww2003-poster.xhtml

are all identical and are each the main text of the paper.  Those XHTML
documents reference the included *.png files and *.css files.  The CSS
files are unchanged as from the distribution site.

Also included in the distribution is:

etl-www-2003-poster.pdf

which is the PDF version of the document (more suitable for the print
proceedings).
